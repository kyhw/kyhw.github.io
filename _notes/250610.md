Installed git, vscode (code oss)
Fixed sleep although there was already a suspend fix t2 service in system/sleep target wants so if I just ran that would that have worked I donâ€™t know
Also contemplating if using vscode is fine or if I should use vim like a sigma male but me already on arch probably will grow a neckbeard if I used vim as well
